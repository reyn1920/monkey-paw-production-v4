# First Month $5,000 Plan — Monkey Paw
**Objective:** reach $5,000 in 30 days via multi-track content + digital kit + affiliates.

## Channels
1) YouTube (daily): 30 videos (800–1200 words), 60 shorts; CTR>5%, AVD>35%.
2) E‑book + Digital Kit weekly: 4 releases bundled with each week’s theme.
3) Newsletter (Beehiiv free tier): 3×/week.
4) Affiliate stacking (free programs): 5 core tools per theme.

## Weekly Targets
- W1: $500, W2: $900, W3: $1,600, W4: $2,000 (Total $5,000).

## Daily Ops
Research → Draft → Repurpose → Publish (gated) → Market (community posts, 5 comments, 3 DMs).

## Offer Ladder
Free lead magnet → $7–$19 mini-kit → $29–$49 core kit → $79 bundle.

## KPI Guardrails
If CTR <4% after 24h → retitle/thumbnail; if AVD <25% → tighten first 15s.
