Local‑first content pipeline (research → draft → repurpose → publish).
Add‑only, feature‑flagged, approval gate before any real publish action.

## Quickstart
- Start: `zsh ./scripts/run_local.zsh`
- Selfcheck: `zsh ./scripts/live_check.zsh`
- Approve publish (gate): `zsh ./scripts/approve_publish.zsh`
