## 🎨 **AI Workflow Strategies**

### **🔥 The Layered Approach (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Start with Cursor Native**
```
Cmd+L → "I want to build a React todo app"
```
Get the overall architecture and plan.

#### **Step 2: Use Cline for Implementation**
```
Cline: "Create the todo app with the plan from Cursor"
```
Let Cline build the structure and files.

#### **Step 3: Speed Code with Supermaven**
```
Start typing → Tab to accept ultra-fast suggestions
```
Fill in details and components quickly.

#### **Step 4: Use Cody for Complex Logic**
```
Cody: "How should I implement state management for this app?"
```
Get codebase-aware suggestions.

### **🚀 The Speed Coding Workflow**

1. **Open Cursor** in your project
2. **Cmd+L** - Ask Cursor to plan your feature
3. **Use Supermaven** for rapid typing and completions
4. **Cmd+K** - Use inline editing for quick fixes
5. **Ask Cody** for complex architectural decisions

### **🏗️ The Complex Project Workflow**

1. **Cline** - "Build me a full-stack app with authentication"
2. **Roo Code** - "Help me plan the database schema"
3. **Cody** - "Review this code for best practices"
4. **Cursor** - "Explain this complex function"

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Maximum AI Power**

### **🎯 Task-Specific AI Usage**

```bash
# Quick code completion
→ Use Supermaven (just type)

# Complex questions
→ Use Cursor Chat (Cmd+L)

# Autonomous building
→ Use Cline or Roo Code

# Codebase analysis
→ Use Sourcegraph Cody

# Multi-language help
→ Use CodeGeeX
```

### **🔄 AI Switching Strategy**

```
1. Start with Cursor for planning
2. Switch to Cline for implementation
3. Use Supermaven for speed coding
4. Ask Cody for optimization
5. Back to Cursor for final review
```

### **⚡ Keyboard Shortcuts Mastery**

```bash
Cmd+L          # Cursor chat
Cmd+K          # Inline editing
Cmd+I          # Generate in place
Cmd+Shift+P    # Command palette (access all AI tools)
Tab            # Accept suggestions
Escape         # Dismiss suggestions
```

## 🎪 **Real-World Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Building a New Feature**
```
1. Cmd+L → "I need to add user authentication to my React app"
2. Get the plan and architecture
3. Cline → "Implement the authentication system with the plan above"
4. Let Cline create files and components
5. Use Supermaven to fill in details quickly
6. Cody → "Review this auth implementation for security issues"
```

### **Example 2: Debugging Complex Code**
```
1. Select buggy code
2. Cmd+Shift+A → Ask Cody "What's wrong with this code?"
3. Get codebase-aware analysis
4. Cmd+K → Use Cursor to fix inline
5. Supermaven → Auto-complete the fix
```

### **Example 3: Learning New Technology**
```
1. Cursor → "Explain GraphQL to me and show examples"
2. CodeGeeX → Get multi-language GraphQL examples
3. Cline → "Build a simple GraphQL API for me"
4. Cody → "How does this fit with my existing codebase?"
```

## 🌟 **Advanced AI Collaboration**

### **🎭 AI Personality Roles**

Think of your AI tools as a development team:

- **Cursor** = Senior Developer (planning, architecture)
- **Cline** = Full-Stack Developer (implementation)
- **Roo Code** = Project Manager (workflow, organization)
- **Cody** = Code Reviewer (analysis, best practices)
- **Supermaven** = Junior Developer (fast coding, completions)
- **CodeGeeX** = Specialist (multi-language expert)

### **🔄 AI Handoff Workflow**

```
Cursor (plan) → Cline (build) → Supermaven (speed) → Cody (review) → Cursor (finalize)
```
