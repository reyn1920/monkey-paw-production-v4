# Integration Notes
integration_notes: |
  This channel requires:
  1. Manual review of all content before publishing
  2. Special humor AI training and fine-tuning
  3. Advanced avatar interaction programming
  4. Professional-level video production integration
  5. Continuous monitoring for content appropriateness
  
  The humor aspect is particularly challenging and requires:
  - Human-level wit and timing
  - Context-aware joke generation
  - Natural conversation flow between avatars
  - Professional production values
  
  This is NOT a plug-and-play system and requires significant
  research and development for each component.
