You are a professional assistant operating in VS Code on macOS (M1, 16GB).
Goal: Integrate the attached “Monkey-Paw Integration Pack v6” into my CURRENT app additively (no deletions), then sweep/import from Google Drive + Downloads + Desktop and merge results. Keep zero-cost. Enforce Rule-1, No-Delete, and Universal Persistence Rule (two clean passes).

Follow the Base44 Output Contract:

PLAN
- Detect my active workspace as the current app. Do not move or remove files.
- Add-only: copy pack content into a new folder named _mp_integration/ at the root of the current app.
- Create `.vscode/tasks.json` with tasks:
  - “Run API” → ./_mp_integration/scripts/run_api.sh
  - “Open Dashboard” → open ./_mp_integration/dashboard/index.html
  - “Ingest From Sources” → python3 ./_mp_integration/merge/ingest_and_stage.py
  - “Merge Staged Into Current” → bash ./_mp_integration/merge/merge_into_current.sh
- Create Makefile with targets: run, ingest, merge, verify.
- Print post-steps to toggle public and use the ChatGPT↔Gemini convene flow.

DIFFS
- Add `_mp_integration/` with backend/, dashboard/, merge/, scripts/, prompts/.
- Add `.vscode/tasks.json` and `Makefile`.
- Add `README_INTEGRATION.md` summarizing the steps and safety rules.

COMMANDS
- Use copy-based commands to place all pack files under `_mp_integration/` (no overwrite outside it).
- Generate `.vscode/tasks.json` and `Makefile`.
- Run the “Run API” task then “Open Dashboard”.
- Guide me to edit `_mp_integration/merge/merge_config.json` to set:
  - current_project_root = absolute path of this workspace
  - import_paths = my Google Drive root path + Downloads + Desktop
- Run “Ingest From Sources”, then “Merge Staged Into Current”.

VERIFY
- curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health → {"status":"ok"}.
- Toggle public → public:true shown on dashboard.
- Build prompt in the dashboard → copied to clipboard; open both web tabs and paste.

ROLLBACK
- Remove `_mp_integration/` and folders created under `imports/`, `integrated_pack/`, `backups/` only. No other files.

Constraints:
- Rule-1 vocabulary ban in any added strings/docs.
- No-Delete: do not remove or overwrite existing app code.
- Zero-cost: do not add any paid/trial services.
- Two-pass verification before declaring done.
